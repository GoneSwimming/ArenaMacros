# ArenaMacros

A set of macros for use with the 2019 Areana League recording spreadsheet. They are designed to work with an Ares results file

Macros are available to:

1. Import times, filling in blank entries in the recording sheet
1. Check times, comparing the AOE results with the spreadsheet and reporting differences
1. CheckSum calculator - Calculates a checksum of the results. Useful for a quick check if you have two records
1. Birthdays - Produce a report of any birthdays on the gala day

#Source Data

You will need an Ares results file for the macros to work.

##Ares
